Day 17 of My 60-Day Web Development Challenge  

Today, I started working on an exciting project called "Web Effects". The idea behind this project is to create a collaborative platform where frontend developers can share and showcase their creative web effects like button animations, hover animations, loading effects, cards, and more.  

I aim to manage the entire platform, including the frontend, backend, and database, with three panels:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Panel: For visitors to explore and use web effects.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Collaborator Panel: For developers to submit and showcase their designs.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Panel: For managing the website and submissions.  

Today, I completed the landing page, and it looks amazing! üéâ If you're interested in collaborating on this project and showcasing your web effects, feel free to DM me. Let‚Äôs create something incredible together!  

What do you think about this idea? Any suggestions for improving the landing page or features you'd like to see on this platform? Let me know in the comments!
